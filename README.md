# Lambda Expressions, Map and Filter Demo
Jupyter Notebook for a demo that presented to software engineering students at Kenzie Academy.

## Creator
- Kash Farhadi


## About

Well take a look at the pros and cons of each function and go over several examples.

Uses a Python 2 Jupyter kernel.

Lambda expressions allow a function to be created and passed around all in one line of code. 

The filter function is used to filter an array and return a new array that meets your criteria.

The map function takes at least one function and an iterable as an argument and returns a new list (returns a generator in python3) that contains the list after being modified by the function.


### Running the Application

Open the Jupyter Notebook Collab link directly. 


Use shift + enter to run each code block and better understand the use of lambda, map and filter functions.
